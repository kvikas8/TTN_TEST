# TTN_TEST

TTN_TEST is a Mobile Coding Challenge to build a listing page for image items.

## Installation

Alfter cloning repo just use the react-native cli to run the app.

```bash
react-native run-ios 
```

## Notes
- As suggested ```Image Api``` is written in native iOS (react native bridge) hence the app will not function properly in Android Platform.
- App only support portrait mode for now.
- App is only tested in iOS (iPhone 11 Simulator) due to time constraint.

## Scope for Improvements
- Proper comments in the code to make it more understandable.
- Better error handling with proper error messages.
- UnitTests etc.
