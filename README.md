# TTN_TEST

TTN_TEST is a Mobile Coding Challenge to build a listing page for image items.

## Installation

Use below commands for installation from Terminal

git clone https://github.com/kvikas8/TTN_TEST.git
cd TTN_TEST
npm install
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
react-native run-ios
```

## Notes

- As suggested ```Image Api``` is written in native iOS (react native bridge) hence the app will not function properly in Android Platform.
- App only support portrait mode for now.
- App is only tested in iOS (iPhone 11 Simulator) due to time constraint.

## Scope for Improvements

- Proper comments in the code to make it more understandable.
- Better error handling with proper error messages.
- UnitTests etc.
